# Distribution map using survey data
## An example of Starry ray, using INLA

Most of the data we collect at sea is spatially and temporally correlated, such as IBTS or BTS survey data.

The statistical package INLA has the advantage over other software in R that it can combine spatial, temporal, zero-inflated, random effects etc models all in one. It therefore is very powerful and may become your one-stop-to-go package.
